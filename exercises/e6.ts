// Return an array with all asteroids names discovered after a given year
export function getAsteroidsDiscoveredAfterYear(asteroids, year) {}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-6"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
