// SPACE DATA EXERCISE 16
// Return the year with the greatest number of Asteroids discoveries
// Return example: 1902
// Hint: use a Map data structure instead of an object if you want typescript to be happy

export function getGreatestDiscoveryYear(asteroids) {}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-16"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
